LIVE WEATHER DASHBOARD

Project Description:

Project Description:

The Live Weather Dashboard is a web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that provides real-time weather information for any location around the world. The system uses a public weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap) to fetch live weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and forecast details.

The dashboard allows users to search for a city or automatically detect their location to display current weather conditions. The user interface presents the data in a clean, interactive, and visually appealing format, helping users to easily understand temperature trends and upcoming forecasts.
